Hereâ€™s how to structure the documentation for the three problems in a GitHub repository format:


### 1. **Problem1-DynamoDB-CRUD/README.md**

```markdown
# Problem 1: DynamoDB CRUD Operations

## Description

Implement a function to perform CRUD operations on a DynamoDB table.

## Requirements

- AWS SDK for Python (boto3)
- Configured AWS credentials

## Example Usage

```python
perform_operation("create", {"userId": "user2", "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com"})
```

## Expected Output

- Successful operation confirmation or error message.

## Notes

- Handle non-existent items during read and update operations gracefully.
```

### 2. **Problem2-RDS-MySQL/README.md**

```markdown
# Problem 2: RDS MySQL Connection and Data Manipulation

## Description

Connect to an Amazon RDS MySQL instance and perform various data operations.

## Requirements

- MySQL connector for Python
- Access to an RDS MySQL instance

## Example Usage

```python
query_products(min_price=500.00)
update_product_price(product_id=1, new_price=899.99)
delete_product(product_id=1)
```

## Expected Output

- Results of the SQL queries and confirmations for updates and deletions.

## Notes

- Ensure proper error handling for database connections.
```

### 3. **Problem3-Redshift-Data-Loading/README.md**

```markdown
# Problem 3: Redshift Data Loading and Querying

## Description

Load data into an Amazon Redshift cluster from S3 and perform SQL queries.

## Requirements

- Redshift connector for Python
- Access to a Redshift cluster and S3 bucket

## Example Usage

```python
calculate_average("amount")
```

## Expected Output

- Data from Redshift queries and calculated averages.

## Notes

- Use the `COPY` command for efficient data loading.
```

This structure provides a clear and organized way to document each problem, making it easy to navigate and understand the requirements and usage for each coding challenge.
